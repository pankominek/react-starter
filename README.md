## Introduction

This starter template provides a robust setup with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, allowing you to focus on building your application without worrying about the initial configuration.

## Features

- **Fast Development**: Vite's lightning-fast HMR ensures a smooth development experience.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript integration provides static typing, reducing bugs and improving code quality.
- **Utility-First CSS**: Tailwind CSS allows for rapid styling using utility classes.
- **Eslint & Prettier**: Integrated for consistent code style and linting.
